'''
In this assignment, we'll build a Rock Paper Scissors game. Rock Paper Scissors is a simple game played between two opponents. Both opponents choose an item from rock, paper, or scissors. The winner is decided according to the following rules:

If player a chooses rock and player b chooses scissors, player a wins.
If player a chooses paper and player b chooses rock, player a wins.
If player a chooses scissors and player b chooses paper, player a wins.
If both players choose the same item, neither player wins. It's a tie.
Our version of the game lets the user play against the computer. The game flow should go like this:

The user makes a choice.
The computer makes a choice.
The winner is displayed.
